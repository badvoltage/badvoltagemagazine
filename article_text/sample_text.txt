Sample Article

In looking over the project, I realized that guidelines would be helpful so 
here's a sample article. To start off, place your article in the .txt file 
format. The rationale is that just about every OS can open and edit .txt 
files.

===========
Bylines 
===========
Looking at the top of the page, it lists the byline like this:
<Author Name>
<AuthorEmail> at <emailprovider> dot <domain_name>

This should keep you, the author from getting spammed and allows to claim your 
stuff. Also the email address is optional if you don't want to be bothered by 
feedback.

============
Subheadings
============
As you have probably noticed, subheadings are done by Surrounding the text with 
equal signs(====). This helps make it easier to identify subheadings for the 
articles

=========
Pictures
=========

If you want to have pictures in the article, please use .jpg or .png for the 
time being. These are decently safe formats. As far as pixel size goes 
be reasonable. Think of picture resolution that 
you would use for a website. Also, community guidelines apply 
here as well and stick to pictures that you have the permissions for. If you 
are uploading the asset to github, please place it in the artwork folder.

Below is an example for marking a picture insert for the article:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<location in artwork folder>
<any caption for the picture>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

========
Misc
========
In closing, the hope is to provide an easy to use format guide for submission 
of articles and to keep the article text separate from the layout and to keep 
it transparent for all. Currently, the plan is to use Scribus for the magazine 
layout but they may change over time.

Personally, I am excited by the possiblites for the magazine and want to be as 
inclusive as possible. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to
